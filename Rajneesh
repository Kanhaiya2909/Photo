Dear Sir/Ma'am,

After trying to crack all the leaked hashes, I found several vulnerabilities in your password
policy and this Email concludes all the findings and suggestions to improve your password
policy.

Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) and Message Digest (MD5) are the standard cryptographic hash
functions to provide data security for authentication.
All the password which are compromised were using MD5 which is weaker and prone to
collisions.

It was very easy to crack with rockyou.txt or crackstation wordlist. I would suggest that you
use a very strong password encryption mechanism to create hashes for the password based on
SHA.

After cracking the password we find following things about organization's password policy:
● Minimum length for password is set to 6.
● There is no specific requirement for the password creation. Users can use any
	combination of word and letters to create a password.
	
You can include several new things in your password policy. My recommendations are:
● Avoid common words and character combinations in your password
● Longer passwords are better. 8 characters is a starting point
● Don't reuse your passwords
● Include special characters, Capital and Small letters, numbers in your password.
● Do not let users include their username, actual name, date of birth and other personal
	information while creating a password.
●Train you users to follow all these policies.

Thank You Regards,
Rajneesh Kumar Tripathi
